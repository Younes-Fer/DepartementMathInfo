                  Essay
                As the corpse went past the flies left the restaurant table in a cloud
                and rushed after it, but they came back a few minutes later.

                The little crowd of mourners-all men and boys, no women--threaded
                their way across the market-place between the piles of pomegranates
                and the taxis and the camels, wailing a short chant over and over
                again. What really appeals to the flies is that the corpses here
                are never put into coffins, they are merely wrapped in a piece of
                rag and carried on a rough wooden bier on the shoulders of four friends.
                When the friends get to the burying-ground they hack an oblong hole a
                foot or two deep, dump the body in it and fling over it a little of the
                dried-up, lumpy earth, which is like broken brick. No gravestone, no
                name, no identifying mark of any kind. The burying-ground is merely a
                huge waste of hummocky earth, like a derelict building-lot. After a month
                or two no one can even be certain where his own relatives are buried.
